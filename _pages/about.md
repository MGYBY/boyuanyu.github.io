I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Civil Engineering Department at McGill University, working with Professor [Vincent Chu](https://www.mcgill.ca/civil/vincent-h-chu-0).

I am originally from [Shijiazhuang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shijiazhuang), China. In my spare time, I like going to the gym, reading books and daydreaming.

Here are some of my research interests:
* Hydrodynamic instabilities.
* Shallow water equations.
* Finite volume method.
* Riemann solvers.
* Roll waves and shear instabilities.
* Multiphase flow.
* Non-Newtonian fluids.
* Open-source CFD.
