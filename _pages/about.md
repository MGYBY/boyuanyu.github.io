I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Civil Engineering Department at McGill University, working with Professor [Vincent Chu](https://www.mcgill.ca/civil/vincent-h-chu-0).

I am originally from [Shijiazhuang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shijiazhuang), China. In my spare time, I like going to the gym, reading books and daydreaming.

Here are some of my research interests:
| * Hydrodynamic instabilities. |  * Shallow water equations. |
| * Finite volume method. |    * Riemann solvers.  |
| * Roll waves and shear instabilities. | * Multiphase flow. |
| * Non-Newtonian fluids. | * Open-source CFD.|
